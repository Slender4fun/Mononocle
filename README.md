# Mononocle
 Hi there

 This is my first repo intendet to be made public, so if you see something that needs a patch, hit me up.

 All projects here are made to be used with [Brilliant Labs](https://brilliant.xyz) Monocle

 ## The Navigation
 My first Project for the Mononocle was a simple navigation so i can have multiple files on my device and decide on the run which one i wanna execute.

 Is basic functional. 


 ## How to use

 You use this like every other code for the monocle:
 - Go to the [developers platform](https://repl.brilliant.xyz/) or get the VS Code plugin also from Brilliant Labs.
 - Connect to your monocle by taking it out of the chargin dock and pressing connect on your pc/smartphone
 - use the "upload" button on the webinterface or the "brilliant labs: build" command to get the files on the device
