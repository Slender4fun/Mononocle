# Mononocle
 Hi there

 This is my first repo intendet to be made public, so if you see something that needs a patch, hit me up.

 All projects here are made to be used with [Brilliant Labs](https://brilliant.xyz) Monocle

 ## The Navigation
 My first Project for the Mononocle was a simple navigation so i can have multiple files on my device and decide on the run which one i wanna execute.
